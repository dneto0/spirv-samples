These samples are extracted from the unit tests for the SPIR-V reader in Tint.

There are 1048 .spvasm files which can be assembled into SPIR-V binary
modules that should be convertable into valid WGSL.

Example:

   tint -format wgsl tint-spvasm-samples/SpvUnaryLogicalTest_LogicalNot_Scalar.spvasm 

The examples work except for a handful of issues:
- crbug.com/tint/860: missing support for transpose
- crbug.com/tint/862: missing support for textureSampleCompareLevel
- crbug.com/tint/863: broken support for bool vector & and |
